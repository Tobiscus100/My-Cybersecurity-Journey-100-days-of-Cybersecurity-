Day 1: 100 Days of Cybersecurity

Wednesday, 25th June, 2025.

As a Cybersecurity Enthusiast, I've previously taken various cybersecurity training courses, but this time I'm starting afresh and documenting my journey. I'm excited to embark on this 100-day challenge, where I'll be sharing my learnings, experiences, and growth in the field of cybersecurity.

I started with the Introduction to Cybersecurity course by Cisco, and today I completed Module 1. I must say, Cisco did an excellent job of breaking down the concepts into bits that are very explanatory and understandable. I'm excited to build on this foundation over the next 99 days. Module 1 covered the basics of cybersecurity, including:
- data security
- Security breaches
- consequences of a security breach
I now have a solid understanding of the importance of cybersecurity in today's digital world. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into the world of cybersecurity and exploring more advanced topics in the coming days. Today's takeaway: cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field that requires continuous learning and adaptation. Module 2 promises more in-depth knowledge about cybersecurity, and I'm eager to move forward. On to Module 2!


Day 2: 100 Days of Cybersecurity

Today I completed Module 2 & 3 and I studied some topics like
Module 2
* Analyzing a Cyber Attack 
* Types of Malware and Common Malwares(spyware,Adware, Backdoor, Random ware, Virus etc.)

Yesterday, I completed Modules 1 to 7 of Networking Basics and had to take the Checkpoint Exam to proceed to Module 8. After that, I decided to start Module 8, but I encountered a snag - I was using my phone and needed to complete an activity on Packet Tracer, which can only be done on my laptop. So, I'll be picking up where I left off tomorrow.

Well, Module 8 is all about the Internet Protocol, starting with IPv4 addresses... Join me on this journey‚ò∫Ô∏è
