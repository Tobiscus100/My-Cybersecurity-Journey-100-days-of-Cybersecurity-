Day 1: 100 Days of Cybersecurity

As a Cybersecurity Enthusiast, I've previously taken various cybersecurity training courses, but this time I'm starting afresh and documenting my journey. I'm excited to embark on this 100-day challenge, where I'll be sharing my learnings, experiences, and growth in the field of cybersecurity.

I started with the Introduction to Cybersecurity course by Cisco, and today I completed Module 1. I must say, Cisco did an excellent job of breaking down the concepts into bits that are very explanatory and understandable. I'm excited to build on this foundation over the next 99 days. Module 1 covered the basics of cybersecurity, including:
- data security
- Security breaches
- consequences of a security breach
I now have a solid understanding of the importance of cybersecurity in today's digital world. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into the world of cybersecurity and exploring more advanced topics in the coming days. Today's takeaway: cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field that requires continuous learning and adaptation. Module 2 promises more in-depth knowledge about cybersecurity, and I'm eager to move forward. On to Module 2!
